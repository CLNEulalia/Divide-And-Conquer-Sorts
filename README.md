# Divide-and-Conquer Sorts

## Overview
This lesson covers two sorting algorithms that use the "divide-and-conquer" method: merge sort and quick sort.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe how to use merge sort and quick sort to sort data.
- Explain the space and time complexities of merge sort and quick sort.
- Identify when to use merge sort or quick sort in a given scenario.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Recursion
* Intro to Sorting


## Activity 

There are a few components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/882)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Merge Sort](./exercises/MergeSort.js)
3. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Quick Sort](./exercises/QuickSort.js)

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**
    1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
    1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWpQW0) provided by the myGA Divide and Conquer module
    1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the exact same

## Additional Resources
* Check out [this visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) for both merge sort and quick sort.
* Revisit our folk-dancing friends, now showing [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaqR3G_NVoo) and [quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8&list=PLuE79vNc5Wi6q34LsQcaJ7ISQ8uOyMaL_&index=4).
* [This tool](http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/) is useful for understanding how quick sort works.
* Watch how these algorithms look sketched out for [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzeBrDU-JaY) and [quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COk73cpQbFQ&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwKedT2KfDMB9YA5DgASZb3U&index=8&t=0s).
